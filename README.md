# Predictive Modelling

This repository contains Python Notebooks for regression and classifications. The main difference between Regression and Classification algorithms is that Regression algorithms are generally used to predict the continuous values such as price and Classification algorithms are used to predict/classify the discrete values.
These notebooks give a complete overview of both the tasks including important pre-processing steps.
